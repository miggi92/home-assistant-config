"""Media player discovery and control service for Beatify.

Playback itself lives in :mod:`custom_components.beatify.services.playback` —
one strategy per platform behind one dispatch point (#2636). What stays here is
what is not per-platform: discovery, the album-art proxy, analytics, volume
save/restore, the metadata wait, the pre-flight check, and the game-lifecycle
bookkeeping that decides WHEN the host's queue is captured and handed back.

        analytics-free way to press play — a platform quirk fixed in
