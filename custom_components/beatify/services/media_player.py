# playback-confirm wait, addressed by the title_advanced fast-path).
# When this times out, Beatify falls back to the playlist's existing
# album_art / title / artist fields; the visible cost is briefly stale
# album art at the top of a round, which the speaker corrects on its own
# state callback within a few seconds.
METADATA_WAIT_TIMEOUT = 2.0

# platforms (Spotify, Music Assistant, etc.) — reading it at the moment of
# content_id/title match returns the previous song's artwork (issue #1260).

# `self._provider` — never tries a different provider's URI.
#
# Why: prior to #805 the cascade walked ALL six URI fields regardless of
# which provider the user picked in the wizard. On Levtos's Apple-Music-only
# MA setup, every round paid 4×15s of timeouts on Spotify/YT/Tidal URIs that
# his MA had no provider configured for, before getting to the Apple Music
# URI that actually worked. After 3 cumulative play_song failures the game
# was force-paused and the admin couldn't recover.
#
# The "fall through to other providers when primary fails" intent of #768
# only makes sense when the user's MA actually has those other providers
# configured — which the wizard already gates. If the user picked Apple
# Music, they're saying "this is the provider MA is set up for". Trust
