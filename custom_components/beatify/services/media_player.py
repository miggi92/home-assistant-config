                 making progress on a new track that shares a token with the
                 expected title, or whose artist matches the expected artist.

            Path 2 was previously only reachable via the 15-second slow-buffer
            tolerance below. Levtos reported that pressing "next" caused the
            UI to lag while the music had already started: the playlist had
            a song with a slightly different title format (e.g. German
            "Das Modell" vs MA's English "The Model", or "(Remastered)"
            suffix mismatches) so the substring-match in path 1 failed and
            the wait timed out. With path 2 in the fast-path, the UI now
            returns within ~1s of MA actually starting playback.

            #1381 tightened Path 2: it used to accept ANY title that differed
            from `title_before`. If the requested URI failed to resolve in MA
            while the speaker's prior queue auto-advanced to its next track
            during the 15s window, that unrelated title was instant-confirmed
            as success — the #795 "guess the year of SongX with no SongX audio"
            class, but silently. Path 2 now requires a cheap similarity gate
            (token overlap / normalized-prefix vs expected_title, OR expected
            artist present in media_artist). The unbounded "any new title"
            acceptance is reserved for the post-timeout #345 branch, where it
            is logged.

            #795 invariant still holds: if the title is unchanged from
            before the call (`title_before`), neither path fires and we
            fall through to the title-must-advance hard-failure check.
