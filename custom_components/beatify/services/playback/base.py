"""The interface every platform answers to (#2636).

Before this, ``MediaPlayerService`` carried Music Assistant, Sonos and Alexa in
one class body, so a Sonos change was one indentation level away from the Music
Assistant path. A strategy is that platform and nothing else: it is handed a
:class:`~.context.PlayerContext`, it answers :meth:`play`, and it says on its
own behalf what it can remember of the host's queue.

Adding a platform (Plex, Jellyfin) is a new file plus one entry in
``_STRATEGIES`` — no existing method is cut open.
