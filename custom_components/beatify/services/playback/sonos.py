"""Sonos playback (#2636).

Sonos speaks plain ``media_player.play_media`` with a Spotify URI, and that is
the whole platform. Its brevity next to
:mod:`.music_assistant` is the point of the split: it used to sit in the same
class body as 600 lines of Music Assistant confirmation logic, so a change here
was one indentation level from that.
