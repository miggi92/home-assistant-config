/**
 * #2617 — the TV froze instead of showing the Paused screen.
 *
 * `dashboard.js` dispatches on the game phase inside one function whose
 * parameter is named `data`. Five of the six branches passed it on; the
 * PAUSED branch passed `state`, which exists nowhere in scope. The file
 * declares `'use strict'`, so reading an undeclared identifier throws a
 * ReferenceError — and it threw BEFORE `showView('dashboard-paused')`, which
 * is why the screen never switched and the TV sat on the previous round with
 * a frozen timer. The whole pause mechanism shipped in 4.4.2 (#2544, #2549,
 * #2551, #2552) was invisible in the room because of it, and the message from
 * #2569 was never displayed.
 *
 * #2701: this used to be two regexes over `dashboard.js` plus one over
 * `dashboard.min.js`. The dispatcher is run for real now — compiled out of the
 * shipped file in strict mode, exactly as the browser compiles it — so the
 * ReferenceError reproduces instead of being described. That also removes the
 * minified assertion: `npm run build:check` already rebuilds every bundle and
 * fails on any drift from its source, so a test grepping terser's output only
 * duplicated that guarantee while breaking whenever terser changes its mind.
