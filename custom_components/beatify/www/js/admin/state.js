/**
 * Beatify Admin — centralized mutable setup-/game-state (#1279 Schritt 5/6).
 *
 * Third real ES module of the admin decomposition and the enabler for the
 * deferred setup-section split (step 4b). Previously these ~24 values lived as
 * top-level `let` bindings inside admin.js. Once admin.js became an ES module
 * (step 2), those bindings stopped being global — but they are also
 * *mutated* across module boundaries (the WS hub in api.js, and soon the
 * setup-section modules in step 4b).
 *
 * ES modules export `let` bindings as LIVE but READ-ONLY views: an importer
 * sees updates but cannot assign. So `import { selectedProvider }` + a later
 * `selectedProvider = x` in another module would throw ("Assignment to
 * constant variable"). To share *mutable* state across modules we therefore
 * export ONE plain mutable object, `adminState`. Every consumer reads
 * `adminState.x` and writes `adminState.x = …` — the object identity is
 * stable, so all modules see the same live values. This is the lowest-friction
 * pattern (no getter/setter pair per field, no DI wiring) and the one with the
 * fewest call-site shapes to touch.
 *
 * What is centralized here = the setup-/game-state the start-game/lobby core
 * and the setup-sections share. What is deliberately NOT here: pure infra
 * handles that are admin-private and never crossed a module boundary —
 * timer/interval ids (`lobbyPollingInterval`, `countdownInterval`,
 * `revealAdvanceInterval`, `revealAdvanceOrigIcon`), the wake-lock internals,
 * the `_homeStartBtnHTML` DOM stash and the `rematchInProgress` debounce flag.
 * Those stay as admin.js `let`s; moving them would add churn without unblocking
 * step 4b.
 *
 * `currentGame` note: api.js reads it via the injected `getCurrentGame()`
 * closure and util.js via the `setCurrentGameResolver()` closure. admin.js
 * keeps both registrations but now points them at `adminState.currentGame`, so
 * both keep seeing live updates after every `adminState.currentGame = …`.
