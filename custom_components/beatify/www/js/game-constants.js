/**
 * Beatify — the handful of values the browser has to agree with the server on.
 *
 * Every constant in here mirrors `custom_components/beatify/const.py`, and
 * `__tests__/game-constants-mirror.test.js` parses that file and fails when the
 * two drift apart. The rule for the rest of `www/js/`: nobody restates these
 * numbers. admin.js, wizard.js, player-utils.js and the admin setup sections
 * import them from here, and the two chip groups and the two join forms are
 * rendered *from* them rather than typed out next to them.
 *
 * The three bugs this module exists for:
 *
 *  - #2627 the name cap sat in five places (const.py, player-utils.js, two
 *    `name.length > 20` literals in admin.js, two `maxlength="20"` attributes).
 *    Raising it server-side would have left a Join button disabled for names
 *    the server accepts.
 *  - #2626 the auto-advance delays sat in three (game_views.py, wizard.js,
 *    admin.html). A chip the UI showed as selected silently ran the game with
 *    auto-advance off.
 *  - #2625 the difficulty scoring table was written out again as prose in the
 *    wizard and — already drifted — in the admin panel. The hints are now
 *    *composed* from the table, so a tuned band cannot leave a false promise
 *    on screen.
 *
 * Pure data and pure functions: no DOM, no state, no imports. Safe to import at
 * module init from anywhere, including the `node` vitest environment.
