"""Game-setup / create-reset-rematch subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction (off ``main``, **not** stacked): the
**game-setup lifecycle** cluster is pulled out of the ``game/state.py``
God-Object into this ``GameSetupMixin``.

The cluster is the "stand a game up, tear it down, and stand it up again"
group: ``create_game`` builds a fresh session from the admin's playlist /
provider / mode selection (token generation, PlaylistManager construction,
storefront detection, round-tracking + config reset, challenge / power-up
configuration), ``end_game`` tears the session back down to an empty LOBBY,
and ``rematch_game`` rebuilds a fresh session while preserving the connected
players and the admin-configured settings. ``_reset_game_internals`` is the
shared field-reset both teardown paths route through (so end and rematch can
never drift), and ``_detect_storefront`` resolves the Apple-Music storefront
the two builders attach to their PlaylistManager. It is **behavior-preserving**:
it carries the exact same methods that previously lived on ``GameState``, so its
public API and every caller / test are unchanged.

* ``create_game`` — the new-session builder, taking its options as a single
  :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.config.GameOptions` (#2635) rather
  than 18 parameters. Validates the round duration, clears any leftover
  sessions, mints a fresh ``game_id`` / ``admin_token``,
  builds the join URL, constructs the :class:`PlaylistManager` (failing fast on
  a provider with zero playable songs, #709), resets round tracking + the
  config-managed fields, and configures the challenge / power-up / intro / mode
  state before flipping to ``LOBBY`` through the ``_set_phase`` chokepoint.
* ``_reset_game_internals`` — the shared field reset used by ``end_game`` and
  ``rematch_game`` (Issue #108, #464). Rebuilds the config-managed fields from
  ``_default_config`` via ``_apply_config`` and delegates round / power-up /
  challenge / highlights resets to the owned managers. Does **not** touch
  players, sessions, phase, ``game_id``, callbacks, service refs, or volume.
* ``end_game`` — tears the session down to an empty LOBBY: cancels the round
  timer + the #1012 REVEAL auto-advance task (synchronously, before the awaits),
  restores lights / disables TTS, runs ``_reset_game_internals``, clears
  ``game_id`` + players + sessions, and notifies the state callbacks.
* ``rematch_game`` — rebuilds a fresh session preserving the connected players
  (Issue #108) and the admin-configured settings (Issue #591): snapshots the
  settings, runs ``_reset_game_internals``, restores the snapshot, re-detects the
  storefront + re-creates the PlaylistManager, resets each player's per-game
  stats, mints a new ``game_id`` / ``admin_token`` and regenerates the join URL.
  The snapshot is a :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.config.GameOptions`
  read back by field name (#2635), not a hand-written dict — the dict was a
  transcript of ``create_game``'s parameter list, and an option missing from it
  silently fell back to its default on the rematch. Since #2648 it also takes
  an optional new song list + playlist selection, so the next game can be a
  different playlist without anyone leaving the room.
* ``_detect_storefront`` — resolves the Apple-Music storefront (#808 follow-up)
  from ``hass.config.country`` (lower-cased) or ``None``; used only by the two
  builders above.

Why the cut stops here: the ``_set_phase`` transition chokepoint (#1273) stays
on ``GameState`` — the builders only *call* it. ``_apply_config`` /
``_default_config``, ``cancel_timer``, ``_cancel_auto_advance``,
``clear_all_sessions``, ``disable_party_lights`` / ``disable_tts`` and the owned
managers (``_playlist_manager``, ``_powerup_manager``, ``_challenge_manager``,
``_round_manager``, ``highlights_tracker``) stay on ``GameState`` too; this mixin
references them via ``self`` and moves none of them.

The mixin relies on attributes / methods the host class owns and that live on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self._set_phase`` — the single phase-transition chokepoint (#1273) the
  builders / teardown route their ``LOBBY`` writes through; stays on
  ``GameState``.
* ``self._apply_config`` / ``self._default_config`` — config-managed field reset
  (game/config.py); used by ``_reset_game_internals``.
* ``self.cancel_timer`` / ``self._cancel_auto_advance`` — round-timer + #1012
  REVEAL auto-advance cancellation on teardown; stay on ``GameState``.
* ``self.clear_all_sessions`` — leftover-session clear on create + teardown.
* ``self.disable_party_lights`` / ``self.disable_tts`` — output restore on
  ``end_game`` (MediaControlMixin / TtsAnnouncerMixin).
* ``self._playlist_manager`` / ``self._powerup_manager`` /
  ``self._challenge_manager`` / ``self._round_manager`` /
  ``self.highlights_tracker`` — the owned managers reset / (re)configured / (re)
  created across the cluster.
* ``self._hass`` — read by ``_detect_storefront`` for the configured country.
* ``self._notify_state_callbacks`` — fired at the end of ``end_game``.

It carries no state of its own. ``GamePhase`` is imported lazily inside the
methods that need it (``# noqa: PLC0415``) to avoid a top-level circular import
back into ``state.py``.
