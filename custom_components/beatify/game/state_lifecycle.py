"""Round-lifecycle / round-start subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction (stacked on the state-serialization cut
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_serialization.StateSerializationMixin`):
the **round-start / round-setup orchestration** cluster is pulled out of the
``game/state.py`` God-Object into this ``RoundLifecycleMixin``.

The cluster is the "kick off the game and set up each new round" half of the
class: the full ``start_round`` orchestration (song selection, playback
dispatch, metadata build, round-state commit) and its setup helpers.

#2717: there used to be a ``start_game`` here as well — a synchronous
LOBBY→PLAYING flip with its own phase + minimum-player gate. Nothing in
production ever called it (both start paths go straight to ``start_round``),
and it could not be adopted either: ``start_round`` keys the sabotage grant and
the crate-digger pre-start hook on ``self.phase == GamePhase.LOBBY``, so
flipping to PLAYING first would silently skip both. It is gone; the phase flip
belongs to ``_initialize_round`` and the start gate to the two handlers a host
actually reaches (``ws_handlers/admin.admin_start_game`` and
``server/game_views.StartGameplayView``).

* ``start_round`` — the round-start orchestrator (#390): pulls the next
  playable song from the :class:`PlaylistManager`, skips/retries songs with no
  provider URI (capped at ``MAX_SONG_RETRIES``), dispatches playback through
  the lazily-created :class:`MediaPlayerService` (classifying ``unavailable``
  storefront skips vs. systemic playback failures per #808 / #949), builds the
  round metadata, commits the round state, flips the lights and fires the
  round-start TTS announcements (#471 / #841 / #842). The single entry point
  every "advance to the next round" caller (``ws_handlers``, ``game_views``)
  hits.
* ``_ensure_media_player_service`` — lazily builds the media-player service on
  the first round via the injected factory (#2638) and wires analytics for
  error recording (Story 19.1), so the service is only created once a media
  player is configured.
* ``_prepare_intro_round`` — thin pass-through to
  ``RoundManager.prepare_intro_round`` (intro-splash deferral decision).
* ``_build_round_metadata`` — thin pass-through to
  ``RoundManager.build_round_metadata`` (initial wire-metadata dict, wiring the
  async metadata fetch coroutine).
* ``_initialize_round`` — commits all round state via
  ``RoundManager.initialize_round`` (timer/deadline, challenge setup, per-player
  round reset), clears ``round_analytics`` and flips to PLAYING through the
  single ``_set_phase`` chokepoint.

Why the cut stops here: the round-*end* path stays on ``GameState``. The shared
``_score_all_players`` loop and ``_end_round_unlocked`` are bound to the
vote-window / scoring coupling and are deliberately NOT moved (see
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_scoring.RoundScoringMixin`). The
REVEAL transition / auto-advance / reveal-lights helpers
(``_transition_to_reveal``, ``_schedule_reveal_advance``,
``_apply_reveal_lights``) also stay on ``GameState`` — they couple to the TTS,
vote-window and party-lights subsystems. The pause/resume + early-reveal +
``advance_to_end`` terminal helpers stay too; this cut is strictly the forward
round-*start* path.

The mixin relies on attributes / methods the host class owns and that live on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self.phase`` / ``self._set_phase`` — phase read + the single transition
  chokepoint used by ``start_round`` / ``_initialize_round``.
* ``self.players`` — the sabotage-grant recipients and the per-player round
  reset list passed to ``RoundManager.initialize_round``.
* ``self._playlist_manager`` — next-song selection, remaining-count
  (``last_round``) and ``mark_played`` for skipped songs.
* ``self.provider`` / ``self.storefront`` / ``self.platform`` /
  ``self.media_player`` — URI resolution and media-player dispatch context.
* ``self._media_player_service`` / ``self._stats_service`` — lazily-built
  playback service + the analytics sink wired into it.
* ``self._service_factories`` — the #2638 injection bundle; supplies the
  media-player factory ``_ensure_media_player_service`` calls.
* ``self._round_manager`` — the :class:`RoundManager` the intro/metadata/commit
  helpers delegate to; also supplies ``_timer_countdown`` / ``_on_round_end``
  callbacks.
* ``self._timer_countdown`` / ``self._on_round_end`` / ``self._fetch_metadata_async``
  — round-end + metadata-fetch callbacks/coroutines wired into ``RoundManager``;
  all stay on ``GameState`` (REVEAL coupling) and are referenced via ``self``.
* ``self._tts_service`` / ``self._tts_pre_round_delay`` — the #1211 pre-round
  TTS deadline shift.
* ``self._cancel_auto_advance`` — supersedes a pending REVEAL auto-advance on a
  new round start (#1012); stays on ``GameState``.
* ``self._lights_set_phase`` — party-light phase sync (owned by
  :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_media.MediaControlMixin`).
* ``self.announce_round_start`` / ``self.announce_countdown`` /
  ``self.announce_last_round`` / ``self.announce_intro_round`` — round-start TTS
  announcements (owned by
  :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_tts.TtsAnnouncerMixin`).
* ``self.deadline`` / ``self.round`` / ``self.current_song`` /
  ``self.last_round`` / ``self.round_analytics`` / ``self.is_intro_round`` /
  ``self.total_rounds`` / ``self.last_error_detail`` / ``self._now`` — round
  state read/written across the orchestration.

It carries no state of its own. ``GamePhase`` is imported lazily inside the
methods that need it (``# noqa: PLC0415``) to avoid a top-level circular import
back into ``state.py``. The concrete ``MediaPlayerService`` is no longer
imported here at all (#2638) — ``_ensure_media_player_service`` calls the
injected factory, so the import graph stays acyclic without a lazy import.

#2710: the post-announcement resume watchdog used to run here too — 215 lines
of ``hass.states.get`` / ``hass.services.async_call("media_player", …)`` inside
``_start_round_locked``, which is why "the game logic does not know Home
Assistant exists" was false on every round with TTS enabled. The loop now lives
on the media-player port (``resume_after_announcement``), next to every other
way this game presses play; what stays here is the announcement budget, the
"was this stopped on purpose" answer only the game can give, and the task.

        The window is the reveal of the second-to-last round, and only that.
        Four options were drawn for this; the one chosen moves the offer back
        one round rather than putting it on the final reveal or on the end
        screen. The reason is that a last round which can be revoked while it
        is being revealed was never a last round — tap it again on the new
        final round and the ending keeps receding. Asking one round early
        leaves the actual finale undisturbed and still gives the host a whole
        song to think during.

        Three conditions, all of them:

        * REVEAL — the standings are on screen and the room is between songs.
        * ``_encore_window``, decided once on the way into this reveal and
          cleared when the next round starts. It is a flag rather than a live
          re-derivation because the first tap moves the finish line: "one song
          left" stops being true the moment the host uses the offer, and a
          re-derived condition would take the control away under their finger.
          The drawn option annotates that a second tap makes it thirty, so the
          offer has to survive its own use and die only when the round starts.
          Set from the pool rather than from ``round >= total_rounds`` for the
          same reason ``last_round`` is (#2421): a song dropped by a playback
          failure is marked played without a round being committed, so the
          counter falls behind reality while the pool does not.
        * the reserve still holds songs. A game whose playlist ran out has
          nothing to extend with, and offering five more rounds that cannot be
          delivered is worse than offering nothing.

        The scores are not reset and are not recomputed — that is the whole
        point of the feature, and it is why the control says so itself rather
