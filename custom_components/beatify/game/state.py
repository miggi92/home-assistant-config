"""Game state management for Beatify.

Subsystem ownership
-------------------
GameState is the central coordinator.  It **owns** (creates and holds
a reference to) the following subsystems:

* ``PlayerRegistry`` — player lifecycle, lookups, sessions, reactions
* ``PowerUpManager`` — steals, bet tracking, streak achievements
* ``ChallengeManager`` — artist challenge & movie quiz state and logic
* ``RoundManager`` — round number, timer/deadline, intro mode, metadata
* ``HighlightsTracker`` — game highlights reel (exact matches, streaks, …)

It **references** (does not own, receives via setter):

* ``StatsService`` — historical game statistics and song difficulty
* ``MediaPlayerService`` — lazy-created on first round via Home Assistant
* ``PartyLightsService`` — optional party-lights integration

Serialization is handled by ``GameStateSerializer`` (game/serializers.py)
which builds broadcast-ready dicts from GameState without GameState
needing to know its own wire format.

Reset logic uses ``GameStateConfig`` (game/config.py), a dataclass
whose fields define every resettable attribute and its default value.

# The legal *forward* phase transitions, derived from every ``_set_phase`` call
# site in this module. This makes the transition graph an explicit, auditable
# data structure layered on the single ``_set_phase`` chokepoint — the exact
# follow-up the ``_set_phase`` docstring invited ("Follow-up increments can
# layer a transition table on top of this single chokepoint").
#
# IMPORTANT — observational, not enforcing: ``_set_phase`` only logs a WARNING
# when an *unexpected* edge is taken; it never raises and never blocks the
# write. This is deliberately behaviour-preserving: it surfaces drift (a new
# transition added without updating this table, or a genuinely illegal flip)
# without ever changing control flow. Exemptions: same-phase writes (e.g. the
# PLAYING→PLAYING next-round commit) and ``restore=True`` resumes are never
# checked — a resume legitimately restores PAUSED→PLAYING / PAUSED→REVEAL.
#
# Edges (source → allowed targets):
#   * LOBBY and END are valid targets from ANY phase — ``start_game`` /
#     rematch / reset re-initialise to LOBBY from anywhere, and
#     ``advance_to_end`` is a documented universal terminal.
#   * LOBBY   → PLAYING            (start_game)
#   * PLAYING → REVEAL, PAUSED     (reveal / pause)
#   * REVEAL  → PLAYING, PAUSED    (next-round commit / pause)
