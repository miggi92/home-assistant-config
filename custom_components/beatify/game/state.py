"""Game state management for Beatify.

Subsystem ownership
-------------------
GameState is the central coordinator.  It **owns** (creates and holds
a reference to) the following subsystems:

* ``PlayerRegistry`` — player lifecycle, lookups, sessions, reactions
* ``PowerUpManager`` — steals, bet tracking, streak achievements
* ``ChallengeManager`` — artist challenge & movie quiz state and logic
* ``RoundManager`` — round number, timer/deadline, intro mode, metadata
* ``HighlightsTracker`` — game highlights reel (exact matches, streaks, …)

It **references** (does not own, receives from outside):

* ``StatsService`` — historical game statistics and song difficulty
* media player — built on first round from the injected factory (#2638)
* party lights — optional, built from the injected factory (#2638)
* TTS announcer — optional, built from the injected factory (#2638)

#2638: GameState does not import ``services.*`` and does not know Home
Assistant exists when it builds these — nor, since #2710, when it drives them:
the post-announcement resume watchdog was the last place the game logic read
``hass.states`` and called a ``media_player`` service itself. It is handed a
``GameOutputFactories`` bundle (game/protocols.py) at construction; the
composition root fills it with HA-backed factories, a test fills it with fakes
or leaves it empty. The admin spectator WebSocket used to live here too — it is
an aiohttp socket the server opens and closes, so it now lives on
``BeatifyWebSocketHandler``.

Serialization is handled by ``GameStateSerializer`` (game/serializers.py)
which builds broadcast-ready dicts from GameState without GameState
needing to know its own wire format.

Reset logic uses ``GameStateConfig`` (game/config.py), a dataclass
whose fields define every resettable attribute and its default value.

#
# The legal *forward* phase transitions, derived from every ``_set_phase`` call
# site in this module. This makes the transition graph an explicit, auditable
# data structure layered on the single ``_set_phase`` chokepoint — the exact
# follow-up the ``_set_phase`` docstring invited ("Follow-up increments can
# layer a transition table on top of this single chokepoint").
#
# IMPORTANT — observational, not enforcing: ``_set_phase`` only logs a WARNING
# when an *unexpected* edge is taken; it never raises and never blocks the
# write. This is deliberately behaviour-preserving: it surfaces drift (a new
# transition added without updating this table, or a genuinely illegal flip)
# without ever changing control flow. Exemptions: same-phase writes (e.g. the
# PLAYING→PLAYING next-round commit) and ``restore=True`` resumes are never
# checked — a resume legitimately restores PAUSED→PLAYING / PAUSED→REVEAL.
#
# Edges (source → allowed targets):
#   * LOBBY and END are valid targets from ANY phase — create_game /
#     rematch / reset re-initialise to LOBBY from anywhere, and
#     ``advance_to_end`` is a documented universal terminal.
#   * LOBBY   → PLAYING            (first round via ``_initialize_round``)
#   * PLAYING → REVEAL, PAUSED     (reveal / pause)
#   * REVEAL  → PLAYING, PAUSED    (next-round commit / pause)

    #
    # ALL writes to ``self.phase`` now go through ``_set_phase`` — including the
    # two ``resume_game`` restores, which pass ``restore=True`` (#1273). There
    # are no remaining direct ``self.phase = …`` assignments anywhere in the
    # codebase. This makes the backend the one authoritative owner of the game
    # phase and gives every transition a single, auditable chokepoint. Two
    # invariants that were previously hand-maintained at each scattered
    # ``self.phase = …`` site are now enforced here so they can never drift:
    #
    #   * ``reveal_started_at`` (#1048) is owned by forward transitions: non-None
    #     *iff* phase is REVEAL — stamped on entry to REVEAL, cleared on every
    #     other forward transition. A ``restore=True`` resume deliberately leaves
    #     it untouched (resume must not restart the auto-advance countdown).
    #   * registered state observers (#441) are notified on every phase change.
    #
    # This centralises the *write* path. An explicit, auditable transition
    # table (``_VALID_PHASE_TRANSITIONS`` above) is now layered on top of this
    # chokepoint: ``_set_phase`` logs a WARNING on any forward edge missing from
    # the table. The check is observational only — it never raises or blocks, so
    # behaviour is unchanged; it exists to surface drift (an un-tabled new edge
    # or a genuinely illegal flip).

        """End the current round WITHOUT scoring it. Issue #2646.

        The host's escape hatch for a round the song ruined — a cover version,
        or twenty seconds of silence out of Music Assistant. ``end_round`` is the
        only other way out of PLAYING and it always scores: everyone who did not
        answer is marked as having missed, their streaks reset
        (``game/scoring.py``), and in Sudden Death one of them is eliminated
        (:meth:`_apply_sudden_death_elimination`) — a player knocked out of the
        game by a broken recording.

        A voided round costs nobody anything and pays nobody anything:

        * **No points, for anyone.** Players who already answered lose their
          guess along with everybody else. Half-scoring a round whose *data* is
          the thing in doubt would credit an accuracy nobody can vouch for, and
          it would make the card on the host's phone ("No points, no broken
          streaks, nobody is eliminated") a lie for three of the eight people in
          the room.
        * **No streak is touched.** ``reset_round()`` clears the per-round
          fields (guess, bet, bonuses) and deliberately leaves ``score``,
          ``streak`` and the #1666 shield alone, so a run survives the round.
        * **Nobody is eliminated**, because the elimination pass never runs.

        The round number does **not** rewind: a voided round 5 is followed by
        round 6, and the game still ends after ``total_rounds`` rounds — one of
        which scored nothing. ``total_rounds`` is the size of the playable song
        pool (#2647), so there is no spare song to hand out as a replacement,
        and rewinding the counter would let a playlist full of covers loop
        forever while ``last_round`` quietly lied about where the game was.

        Playback is stopped: the reason the host reached for this is that the
        thing coming out of the speaker is wrong.

        Args:
            reason: Optional reason chip the host picked (see
                ``VOID_ROUND_REASONS``). Recorded, never acted on — where such
                reports should go is not decided, so nothing in the UI promises
                that anyone will read them.

        Returns:
            True if the round was voided, False if the phase had already moved
            on (timer fired, a second admin socket got there first).

        1. Every round delta is >= 0 (a lost bet zeroes the score, it never goes
