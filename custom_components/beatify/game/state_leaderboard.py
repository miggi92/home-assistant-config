"""Leaderboard subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction: the leaderboard / ranking cluster
(``get_leaderboard``, ``_store_previous_ranks``, ``get_final_leaderboard`` —
originally Stories 5.5 / 5.6) is pulled out of the ``game/state.py``
God-Object into this ``LeaderboardMixin``.

The mixin is **behavior-preserving**: it carries the exact same methods that
previously lived on ``GameState``. ``GameState`` inherits them, so its public
API and every caller / test are unchanged.

The mixin relies on a single attribute the host class owns and that lives on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self.players`` — mapping of player name → ``PlayerSession``. Each session
  exposes ``score``, ``name``, ``streak``, ``is_admin``, ``connected``,
  ``previous_rank``, ``best_streak``, ``rounds_played`` and ``bets_won``.

It carries no state of its own and imports nothing from ``state.py``, so the
extraction introduces no cyclic imports.
