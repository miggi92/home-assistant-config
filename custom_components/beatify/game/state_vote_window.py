"""Title & Artist vote-window subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction: the **title/artist REVEAL vote-window**
cluster is pulled out of the ``game/state.py`` God-Object into this
``VoteWindowMixin``.

This is the scheduling + finalization half that the challenge-delegation cut
(:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_challenge.ChallengeMixin`)
deliberately left behind — there the *read* surface (``is_title_artist_voting_open``,
``title_artist_vote_seconds_remaining``, …) was extracted, while the writers
that own the REVEAL dwell stayed on ``GameState`` because they are coupled to
the round scoring lock and the auto-advance task. This mixin now carries that
writer cluster (#1180 Phase 4):

* ``_schedule_title_artist_vote_window`` — opens (or skips) the conditional 30s
  near-miss window from the round-end path; reuses the ``_auto_advance_task``
  slot so a manual advance / pause / end cancels it.
* ``_title_artist_vote_window`` — the window task that holds REVEAL open, then
  finalizes near-misses, scores the deferred round, and re-broadcasts on expiry.
* ``_finalize_title_artist_window`` — resolves near-misses and applies the
  deferred title/artist scoring pass under the score lock (idempotent via the
  ``voting_open`` guard).
* ``_score_title_artist_round`` — the deferred per-player scoring pass; caller
  holds the lock.
* ``resolve_title_artist_if_pending`` — finalizes an open window early when the
  host advances (called from the next_round admin handler).

The mixin is **behavior-preserving**: it carries the exact same methods that
previously lived on ``GameState``, so its public API and every caller / test
are unchanged.

The mixin relies on attributes / methods the host class owns and that live on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self.title_artist_mode`` — whether the title/artist challenge mode is on
  (a :class:`ChallengeMixin` property).
* ``self.has_near_misses`` / ``self._challenge_manager.resolve_title_artist``
  — the near-miss query + resolution surface delegated to the
  :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.challenges.ChallengeManager`.
* ``self._title_artist_voting_open`` / ``self._title_artist_vote_deadline`` —
  the server-owned REVEAL vote-window flag + deadline (in ``self._now`` units);
  this mixin is the writer of those fields.
* ``self._now`` — the monotonic-ish clock callable used for the vote deadline.
* ``self._cancel_auto_advance`` / ``self._auto_advance_task`` — the REVEAL
  auto-advance task handle this window reuses (so a manual next_round / pause /
  end cancels the window via the same path).
* ``self._score_lock`` — the asyncio lock guarding score mutations; the
  deferred scoring pass runs under it.
* ``self._score_all_players`` — the shared per-player scoring loop (stays on
  ``GameState`` so the round-end and vote-window paths cannot drift).
* ``self._append_round_results`` — the shared round_results classifier (owned by
  :class:`RoundScoringMixin`); called after the deferred scoring pass so the
  share grid reflects the resolved title/artist field statuses (#1373).
* ``self.players`` / ``self.current_song`` / ``self.phase`` — round state read
  while the window is open.
* ``self._on_round_end`` — the async broadcast callback fired after expiry.

It carries no state of its own. ``GamePhase`` is imported lazily inside the
window task (matching the ``powerups`` / ``serializers`` pattern) to avoid the
cyclic import with ``state.py`` (which imports this mixin at module load), so
the extraction introduces no import cycle.
