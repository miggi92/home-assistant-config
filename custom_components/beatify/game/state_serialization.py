"""State-serialization & game-summary subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction (stacked on the round-scoring cut
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_scoring.RoundScoringMixin`):
the **state-serialization + game-summary / performance dict-builder** cluster
is pulled out of the ``game/state.py`` God-Object into this
``StateSerializationMixin``.

The cluster is the read-only "turn GameState into a wire/summary dict for the
frontend and the :class:`StatsService`" half of the class. It is **behavior-
preserving**: it carries the exact same methods that previously lived on
``GameState``, so its public API and every caller / test are unchanged.

* ``get_state`` — broadcast snapshot for the frontend (#464); a thin wrapper
  that delegates the actual view assembly to
  :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.serializers.GameStateSerializer`.
* ``get_reveal_players_state`` — REVEAL-phase per-player view rows (#464); also
  delegated to ``GameStateSerializer``.
* ``set_stats_service`` — wires the optional :class:`StatsService` reference
  used by the summary / performance / difficulty builders below.
* ``get_song_difficulty`` — difficulty lookup for a song URI; delegates to the
  wired ``StatsService`` (or ``None`` when unset).
* ``finalize_game`` — builds the end-of-game summary dict (Story 14.4): winner
  (incl. tie detection), totals, average-per-round, playlist name, and the
  streak / bet aggregates. Must run BEFORE ``end_game()`` so the totals are
  still present. Consumed by ``StatsService.record_game()``.
* ``_calculate_current_avg`` — helper for the live game's average score per
  round (Story 14.4), used by ``get_game_performance`` for the all-time
  comparison.
* ``get_game_performance`` — builds the motivational performance-comparison
  dict shown in REVEAL / END (Story 14.4); returns ``None`` when no
  ``StatsService`` is connected. Both ``GameStateSerializer`` REVEAL/END paths
  call this on ``self``.

Why the cut stops here: the heavy view-assembly logic already lives in
``game/serializers.py`` (:class:`GameStateSerializer`, #464); this mixin only
carries the GameState-side entry points + the summary/performance dict builders
that read live game state directly. The per-player leaderboard rows
(``get_players_state`` etc.) stay in
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_player.PlayerLifecycleMixin` and
the ranking in
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_leaderboard.LeaderboardMixin`;
this cut deliberately touches neither so the two cannot drift.

The mixin relies on attributes / methods the host class owns and that live on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self.players`` — player map read for totals / winner / averages.
* ``self.round`` — rounds-played count for the summary + average.
* ``self.playlists`` — used to derive the playlist name for the summary.
* ``self.streak_achievements`` / ``self.bet_tracking`` — power-up aggregates
  folded into the summary dict (Story 19.11 / 19.12).
* ``self._stats_service`` — optional :class:`StatsService`; gates the
  difficulty / performance builders and is the summary's downstream consumer.

It carries no state of its own. ``GameStateSerializer`` is imported lazily
inside the two view delegators (``# noqa: PLC0415``) to avoid a top-level
import cycle (``serializers`` imports from this package), matching the lazy-
import discipline of the sibling state_*.py mixins.
