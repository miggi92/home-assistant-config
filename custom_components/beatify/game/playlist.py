    The rule is mechanical, in three passes, so the same room always sees the
    same grid:

    1. **The one just played** comes first and is marked ``current``. A game
       built from several playlists collapses into a single tile that re-plays
       the whole selection — that is what "again" means for such a game.
    2. **Most recently played, newest first**, from the local analytics game
       log (``recent_stems`` — file stems, which is what a GameRecord stores).
       This is the answer to "what does this household actually put on".
    3. **The catalogue, in discovery order**, to fill whatever the first two
       passes left empty. A fresh install has no history at all, and a grid of
       two tiles next to a search box is worse than a full one.

    Playlists that discovery found unusable (no playable songs) never make it
    into a tile — offering one is offering a dead end.
