"""Game state serialization for Beatify (Issue #464).

Extracts ``get_state()`` and ``get_reveal_players_state()`` view logic
from GameState into a standalone serializer so the god object does not
own its own presentation layer.

GameState.get_state() becomes a thin wrapper calling
``GameStateSerializer.serialize(game_state)``.
