"""Pause / resume subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction (stacked on the round-lifecycle cut
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_lifecycle.RoundLifecycleMixin`):
the **pause / resume** cluster is pulled out of the ``game/state.py``
God-Object into this ``PauseResumeMixin``.

The cluster is the "freeze the game and thaw it back to where it was" pair: a
game pause (typically an admin disconnect, but also any server-side pause such
as ``media_player_error`` / ``no_songs_available``) snapshots the live phase,
stops the timers + media playback, and flips to ``PAUSED``; the resume restores
the snapshotted phase, restarts the round/intro timers against the *remaining*
deadline and resumes media playback. It is **behavior-preserving**: it carries
the exact same methods that previously lived on ``GameState``, so its public API
and every caller / test are unchanged.

* ``pause_game`` — the PLAYING/REVEAL→PAUSED gate. Stores the live phase in
  ``_previous_phase`` for the resume, records the ``pause_reason`` and (for any
  reason, #790) the disconnected admin's name so a later admin-WS drop stays
  recoverable, supersedes the unattended REVEAL auto-advance (#1012), and — only
  when pausing out of PLAYING — cancels the round + intro timers (#23) and stops
  media playback before flipping to ``PAUSED`` through the single ``_set_phase``
  chokepoint (#1273).
* ``resume_game`` — the PAUSED→(previous phase) restore. Restarts the round
  timer against the *remaining* deadline (and the #416/#496 intro-stop timer
  against actual playing time) and resumes media playback when resuming to
  PLAYING; if the deadline already elapsed during the pause it restores the
  phase and ends the round immediately. The phase write always routes through
  ``_set_phase(restore=True)`` so a resume-to-REVEAL does **not** re-stamp
  ``reveal_started_at`` (the auto-advance countdown must not restart, #1273).

Why the cut stops here: the ``_set_phase`` transition chokepoint (#1273) stays
on ``GameState`` — pause/resume only *call* it. ``_timer_countdown``,
``_cancel_auto_advance``, ``cancel_timer`` and ``end_round`` stay on
``GameState`` too (the round-end / REVEAL path); this mixin references them via
``self`` and moves none of them.

The mixin relies on attributes / methods the host class owns and that live on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self.phase`` / ``self._set_phase`` — phase read + the single transition
  chokepoint (``restore=True`` resume write); stays on ``GameState``.
* ``self._previous_phase`` / ``self.pause_reason`` /
  ``self.disconnected_admin_name`` — the pause snapshot, initialised in
  ``create_game`` and owned by ``GameState``; read/written across the pair.
* ``self.players`` — the admin-name capture loop in ``pause_game``.
* ``self._cancel_auto_advance`` / ``self.cancel_timer`` — supersede the pending
  REVEAL auto-advance and the round timer on pause; stay on ``GameState``.
* ``self._timer_countdown`` / ``self.end_round`` — round-end callbacks the
  resume restarts / triggers; stay on ``GameState`` (REVEAL coupling).
* ``self._round_manager`` — the :class:`RoundManager` whose intro timer is
  cancelled on pause and whose round/intro timer tasks are restarted on resume.
* ``self._media_player_service`` — playback stop on pause / play on resume.
* ``self.deadline`` / ``self.current_song`` / ``self.is_intro_round`` /
  ``self.intro_stopped`` / ``self._now`` — round state read across the resume
  timer-restore math.

It carries no state of its own. ``GamePhase`` is imported lazily inside the
methods that need it (``# noqa: PLC0415``) to avoid a top-level circular import
back into ``state.py``; ``_log_timer_task_failure`` is likewise imported lazily
inside ``resume_game`` (matching the original).
