"""Media-player & party-lights output subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction: the external-output cluster — media
transport (``stop_media``, ``set_volume_on_player``, ``seek_forward``,
``play_deferred_song``), party-lights control (``configure_party_lights``,
``disable_party_lights``, ``_lights_set_phase``, ``_lights_flash``) and the
host-side ``adjust_volume`` helper — is pulled out of the ``game/state.py``
God-Object into this ``MediaControlMixin``.

The mixin is **behavior-preserving**: it carries the exact same methods that
previously lived on ``GameState`` (originally Stories 6.4 / Issues #321 /
#331 / #498). ``GameState`` inherits them, so its public API and every
caller / test are unchanged.

The mixin relies on attributes the host class owns and that live on ``self``
at runtime:

* ``self._media_player_service`` — :class:`MediaPlayerProtocol` instance (or
  ``None`` before the first round), the transport all playback flows through.
* ``self._party_lights`` — :class:`PartyLightsProtocol` instance (or ``None``).
* ``self._service_factories`` — the #2638 injection bundle; its ``party_lights``
  factory builds the service ``configure_party_lights`` installs. The mixin no
  longer touches ``self._hass`` at all.
* ``self._bg_tasks`` — set of fire-and-forget background tasks.
* ``self.volume_level`` — current game volume, clamped 0.0–1.0.

It carries no state of its own and imports nothing from ``state.py`` at
runtime (``GamePhase`` is a typing-only import), so the extraction introduces
no cyclic imports.
