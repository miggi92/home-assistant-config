"""TTS announcement subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 first-increment extraction: the TTS / spoken-announcement
cluster (~365 lines, originally Issues #447 / #471 / #840 / #841 / #842 /
#1211) is pulled out of the ``game/state.py`` God-Object into this
``TtsAnnouncerMixin``.

The mixin is **behavior-preserving**: it carries the exact same methods that
previously lived on ``GameState`` (``configure_tts``, ``disable_tts``, the
``announce_*`` family, plus the private ``_lang`` / ``_tts_announce`` /
``_announce_reveal`` helpers). ``GameState`` inherits them, so its public API
and every caller / test are unchanged.

The mixin relies on attributes that the host class owns and that live on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self._hass`` — Home Assistant instance (for the TTS provider).
* ``self._bg_tasks`` — set of fire-and-forget background tasks.
* ``self.media_player`` — speaker entity the audio is routed through.
* ``self.language`` — game language (resolved defensively via ``_lang``).
* ``self.players`` / ``self.total_rounds`` / ``self.round`` /
  ``self.difficulty`` / ``self.closest_wins_mode`` — read for phrasing.

The ``_tts_*`` state (service handle, per-event toggles, dedup sets) is
initialized by :meth:`_init_tts_state`, which ``GameState.__init__`` calls so
the attributes exist before any announcement fires.
