"""Resolve external song picks against the enriched library pool.

This is the bridge that makes AI-curated (or hand-written) playlists safe for
the library provider: an LLM (or a human) supplies picks as plain
``{"artist": ..., "title": ...}`` pairs -- never URIs, never years -- and this
module resolves each pick against the user's own pool, attaching the verified
year and the playable ``uri_ma_library`` from the pool entry. Anything the
pool can't confidently match is reported back as unmatched instead of being
guessed at.

Why picks must not carry URIs or years: an LLM will happily hallucinate both,
and the whole point of the library provider is that years are externally
verified and URIs are guaranteed-playable. The pool is the single source of
truth; picks are only selectors into it.

Matching is normalized (case/accents/punctuation-insensitive, version-suffix
stripped, feat.-credit tolerant on the artist) via the same `_norm_key`
machinery the generator uses for dedupe, so "Bohemian Rhapsody - 2011
Remaster" by "Queen" matches the pool's "Bohemian Rhapsody".

Pure module: no Home Assistant, no network. Unit-tested.
