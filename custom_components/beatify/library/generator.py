"""Generate a Beatify playlist by sampling the enriched library pool.

This is the piece that makes the game "infinitely re-playable": the slow work
(library scan + year/popularity enrichment) is done once into a cached pool;
each game samples a fresh playlist from it in microseconds. Re-roll = re-sample.

Design goals encoded here:
  * Trust:        only include songs whose resolved year clears `min_confidence`
                  (default: verified MusicBrainz years only).
  * Difficulty:   bias selection toward the slider's familiarity band, but spill
                  over into adjacent bands if the band is too small to fill the
                  requested size (a half-empty game is worse than a slightly
                  easier one).
  * Fairness:     bands are cut on ABSOLUTE worldwide fame by default, so a
                  guest never has to know the host's niche favourites.
  * Spread:       balance across decades so the year-guessing game isn't 30
                  songs from 2015-2020.
  * No dupes:     dedupe by normalized (artist, title) so the same song from two
                  albums can't appear twice.

Output is a dict in Beatify's exact playlist schema, so it flows through the
existing PlaylistManager / MediaPlayerService unchanged. The only new field is
`uri_ma_library`, the Music-Assistant URI captured at scan time.

`generate_playlist` is pure (seedable RNG) and unit-tested.
