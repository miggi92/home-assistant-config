"""Build and cache the enriched library pool.

Two-phase model (this is what makes it both trustworthy AND instantly
re-playable):

  PHASE 1 - build_pool (slow, run once, cached):
     scan MA library -> resolve trustworthy years (MusicBrainz authoritative)
     -> fetch popularity (MA-native / Deezer / Last.fm) -> global fame scores
     -> write JSON. Rate-limited and incremental: re-running only enriches
     new/unenriched tracks, so a refresh is cheap after the first build.

  PHASE 2 - generator.generate_playlist (instant, every game):
     sample from the cached pool. No network. Re-roll = re-sample.

The cache lives at `<config>/beatify/playlists/user/_library_pool.json`.
Enrichment is best-effort: a track that MB/Deezer can't resolve still lands in
the pool with whatever confidence its tags earned. Only the year-confidence
gate (applied later, in the generator) decides what actually reaches a game.
