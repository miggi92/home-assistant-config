"""Release-year resolution for library-sourced songs.

THE central data-quality problem for library-generated playlists: Beatify is a
*year-guessing* game, so every song needs a trustworthy original-release year.
Local file tags are unreliable for this -- they come from whoever ripped/tagged
the file, vary wildly between libraries, and compilations/remasters re-stamp the
pressing year (a 1975 track on a 2010 hits album is tagged 2010). On a friend's
worse-tagged library the problem is worse, and the *guest* pays for it.

So this resolver treats EXTERNAL sources as authoritative and tags as a last
resort that is OFF by default. Confidence tiers (high -> low):

    EXTERNAL_PRIMARY    MusicBrainz, match-quality-checked. Default & only tier
                        used unless the caller opts into more.
    EXTERNAL_SECONDARY  A second external source (e.g. Deezer release year),
                        used to recover coverage for MB misses when enabled.
    TAG_STUDIO          Tag year from a studio album/single -- only if the
                        caller explicitly allows tags.
    TAG_COMPILATION     Tag year from a compilation/live/soundtrack -- lowest;
                        almost certainly the pressing year, not the song's.
    NONE                Nothing usable -> excluded from the game.

The default generation gate is EXTERNAL_PRIMARY, i.e. a song needs a confident
MusicBrainz year to be playable. This favours accuracy over pool size; the
build reports coverage so the user can decide whether to relax the gate.

MusicBrainz matching is hardened: results are filtered by MB's own match
`score` AND the artist credit is verified against the query, then the earliest
plausible release among those confident matches is taken (so a remaster can't
outrank the original, while a same-title-different-song can't sneak in).

All decision logic here is pure and unit-tested; only the two `async_*`
functions touch the network.
