"""Crate Digger — user corrections to the enriched pool.

A library game is played against the host's OWN data, so when a song shows the
wrong year the fix belongs here, not in a report to whoever published a
playlist. This module holds the pure logic behind that:

* ranking MusicBrainz candidates for a song so the host can pick the right
  recording (or see that the track was misidentified entirely),
* applying a correction to a pool entry, and
* marking it so later scans and refresh passes never overwrite it.

Corrections are recorded at :data:`YearConfidence.USER_VERIFIED`, above every
automatic source: a human who owns the file and looked at the release is a
better authority than a fuzzy search, and the strictest year gate must never
exclude a song the host has personally confirmed.
