"""Library-sourced playlist provider for Beatify.

Generates Beatify playlists from the user's own Plex / Jellyfin / local library
(via Music Assistant) instead of relying on curated, streaming-specific
playlists. This sidesteps mholzi's blocker in issue #45 ("users may not have the
songs from a curated playlist") by construction: every song is sourced from the
user's library, so it is always present and always playable.

Two hard problems this package solves (see year_resolver.py / popularity.py):
  1. Trustworthy release years (the game scores year guesses): external sources
     are authoritative (MusicBrainz, match-verified), with tags gated out by
     default so unreliable years never reach a game.
  2. A real difficulty / familiarity slider via worldwide popularity (MA-native,
     or keyless Deezer / optional Last.fm), banded on an absolute global-fame
     scale so it's fair across different people's libraries.

Public surface:
  async_build_pool(hass, ...)        -> scan + enrich + cache (slow, run once)
  async_generate_library_playlist()  -> sample a fresh playlist (instant)
  pool_stats(pool)                   -> counts for the admin UI

Note: the pure-logic modules (year_resolver, popularity, generator) have no
Home Assistant dependency and can be imported standalone. The HA-dependent
pieces (pool, ma_client) are imported lazily so this package's logic remains
unit-testable without Home Assistant installed.
