"""Smart Playlist Mixer HTTP view for Beatify (#1538).

Assembles a transient, de-duplicated song set on the fly from the existing
playlist catalogue based on the tags the host picks in the "Mix" tab
(decade / style / region / special — the same taxonomy that already drives the
playlist filter bar, see ``www/js/admin/constants.js`` ``TAG_CATEGORIES``).

Design goals (kept deliberately minimal-invasive):

* No new game-start path. The mixer writes the assembled set to a playlist
  JSON on disk and returns its ``path``; the frontend then feeds that path into
  the *existing* ``/beatify/api/start-game`` flow exactly like any hand-picked
  playlist. So all the validated start-game logic (provider checks, platform
  capabilities, PlaylistManager dedup/selection) is reused untouched.
* Transient mixes land in ``<config>/beatify/playlists/mix/__mix__-<uuid>.json``
  with a UNIQUE stem per run (so two parallel games never clobber each other —
  #1547) — they are an implementation detail, not a saved artefact. Stale
  transient files are best-effort cleaned up on each write. The ``mix/`` folder
  is treated as ``bundled`` by discovery (only ``community``/``user`` count as
  community), so a transient mix never pollutes the Community tab.
* When the host ticks "save as community playlist" the assembled set is instead
  persisted into ``user/<slug>.json`` (the same place ``SavePlaylistView`` uses)
  so ``async_discover_playlists`` surfaces it in the Community tab on refresh.
