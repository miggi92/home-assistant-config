"""HA Android Companion auth-bypass helpers (#1131, #1120, #1114).

The HA Android Companion App ships a WebView that intercepts OAuth redirects
to ``/auth/authorize``, so the standard ha-auth.js token bootstrap dies on
"Invalid redirect URI" before any beatify endpoint sees a Bearer token. The
``externalAppV2`` bridge (rc5+) is the documented escape hatch, but several
Companion builds either don't expose it or expose it intermittently.

This module provides a narrowly-scoped bypass: when a request bears all
three indicators of an HA Android Companion WebView on the local network,
beatify treats it as authenticated even without a Bearer token. The bypass
is intentionally conservative — desktop browsers, iOS Companion, and any
internet-origin request fall through to the unchanged OAuth path.

#1357 hardening — the bypass is now **opt-in and OFF by default**, gated on
the ``enable_companion_auth_bypass`` integration option (stored live in
``hass.data[DOMAIN]["companion_auth_bypass_enabled"]``). Two further defenses
close the "internet-reachable bypass" hole:

  * **No loopback in the trusted set.** ``127.0.0.0/8`` / ``::1/128`` are
    deliberately excluded — a Companion WebView never connects from loopback,
    only reverse proxies and Nabu Casa's snitun tunnel terminator do (snitun
    hands requests to HA from 127.0.0.1). Removing loopback is the primary
    structural defense for the Nabu Casa setup.
  * **Cloud-connection refusal.** On the HTTP path we additionally consult
    HA's ``is_cloud_connection(hass)`` helper and refuse the bypass for
    cloud-tunnelled requests (defense-in-depth).

Threat model: with the bypass enabled, the only added attack surface is
"anyone on the local network who can spoof an HA-Android-Companion
User-Agent gains the admin endpoints that #998 protects (lights inventory,
TTS trigger, host a game)". On a residential LAN this is roughly equivalent
to "the network is already trusted"; on a hostile LAN, leave
``enable_companion_auth_bypass`` off (the default).
