"""Extracted WebSocket message handlers for Beatify.

Contains game-action handlers (join, submit, admin actions, steal, etc.)
split out from BeatifyWebSocketHandler to reduce module size.
Each function receives (handler, ws, data, game_state) where *handler*
is the BeatifyWebSocketHandler instance (needed for broadcasting and
task management).
