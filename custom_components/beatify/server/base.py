    Before rc16 this used the key ``error``, which caused two regressions:

    1. ``admin.js`` checks ``data.code === 'GAME_IN_LOBBY'`` to silently
       recover when a LOBBY game already exists; with the old key the
       check was dead code and the user got dropped into a modal with
       the raw English message instead of the seamless gameplay start.
    2. The ``errors.<CODE>`` i18n lookup (also reading ``data.code``)
       never fired, so German / Spanish / French / Dutch users saw the
       raw English ``message`` for every REST-side error response.

    The ``error`` key is kept too so anything still reading it from
    older builds doesn't break — drop after a few releases.
