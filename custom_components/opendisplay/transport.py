"""Transport resolution for OpenDisplay deliveries (BLE vs WiFi/LAN).

A single OpenDisplay tag exposes at most one BLE link *and*, when WiFi-enabled,
a TCP/LAN endpoint discovered via mDNS (protocol 2.2 SECTION 9). Both transports
address the same device by its BLE MAC (the config entry's ``unique_id``), so the
process-global per-MAC lock in ``ble_lock.py`` serializes them transparently —
this module never touches the lock; callers hold it around the whole delivery.

Resolution rule (H3): prefer WiFi when the entry carries a ``CONF_HOST`` *and* the
device was seen via mDNS within ``MDNS_FRESHNESS_WINDOW`` (fed by the zeroconf
config-flow step, see ``note_mdns_seen``); otherwise use BLE. Any WiFi failure
(unreachable / connect / TLS handshake / mid-transfer / stale port) falls back to
BLE for that same delivery — a hard requirement — via ``async_run_with_fallback``.
