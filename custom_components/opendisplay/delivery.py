"""Wake-triggered delivery of queued work to deep-sleeping OpenDisplay devices.

A sleeping ESP32 tag is dark most of the time and reachable only during a short
advertising window after each timer wake. The `DeliveryManager` owns the work
that could not be delivered immediately (a prepared image, a config resync) and
drains it over a single BLE connection the moment the device is seen advertising
again.

Design (see docs/DEEP_SLEEP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-07-06.md, D4):

* Latest-wins per work type — only the newest image survives, matching the
  existing live-upload semantics.
* One connection per wake — the device stays awake while connected, so all
  pending work drains over a single session in priority order (upload first).
* Transport-agnostic trigger — `notify_device_seen(source)` is the entry point;
  today the BLE coordinator calls it, a future WiFi presence tracker could too.
* Memory-only in v1 — a HA restart drops a pending upload (documented).
