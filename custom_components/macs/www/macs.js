/**
 * M.A.C.S. is a mood-aware SVG character who reacts to your smart home.
 * This file handles the Home Assistant Backend Integration.
 */



/** 
 * TO-DO
 * --------
 * - leaves only appear at top
 * 
 * - test non-admin user
 * - change happy trigger from idle to responding. Actually, idle OR responding, whichever comes first.
 * 
 * - rethink debugger. When first created, I thought backend could post to debug div, but it can't because it's in an iframe.
 * - so, use console for backend, and debug div for frontend, makes it much easier to separate then.
 * - highlight errors in debug ui.
 * - Use assist dialogue to display errors
 * - don't pass MacsFrontend debug functions to fx files. the namespace is wrong in debug output.
 * 
 * - Reduce service registration boilerplate in __init__.py by driving async_register/async_remove from a single mapping (service → handler → schema). 
 * - Collapse the repetitive weather-condition switch classes in entities.py into a tiny factory/base class with a definition list (name/icon/unique_id).
 * - Consolidate the _sendTemperature/_sendWindSpeed/_sendPrecipitation/... helpers in MacsCard.js into a table-driven sender so change checks + postMessage are in one place.
 * - Deduplicate the normalize/read logic in sensorHandler.js (temperature/wind/precip/battery are almost identical patterns).
 * - Replace the long if (e.data.type === ...) chain in MacsFrontend.js with a message-handler map to make intent clearer and reduce branching noise.
 *
 * NEW FEATURES
 * - add seasons: christmas, halloween etc.
 * - train "Hey Macs" wakeword
 * - add a macs.show handler - "show me my shopping list", "show me my camera" etc?
