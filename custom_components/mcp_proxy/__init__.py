"""MCP Webhook Proxy - routes MCP requests to the ha-mcp addon via webhook.

This integration is auto-installed by the webhook proxy addon when started.
By default it registers an UNAUTHENTICATED webhook endpoint that proxies
MCP requests to the ha-mcp addon, allowing remote access via any reverse
proxy (Nabu Casa, Cloudflare, DuckDNS, nginx, etc.). The webhook URL itself
is the shared secret in this default mode.

Authentication is selected by the add-on's OAuth mode. All three modes expose
the proxy-owned scoped discovery and authorization surface: ha_auth validates
Home Assistant bearer tokens, legacy uses the proxy's embedded provider, and
none mode keeps the secret webhook URL as the only credential while completing
client-mandated OAuth invisibly with a cosmetic token.

Configuration is read from /config/.mcp_proxy_config.json, which is written
by the proxy addon's startup script. No manual configuration is needed — the
addon creates the config entry automatically via the HA API.
