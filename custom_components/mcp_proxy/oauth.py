"""OAuth 2.1 provider for the MCP Webhook Proxy.

This module is lazy-imported by `__init__.py` ONLY when the user has
enabled the OAuth toggle. When OAuth is off the import never runs and the
proxy behaves exactly like a vanilla unauthenticated webhook.

Implements the subset of OAuth 2.1 required by the MCP spec:
- Authorization-code grant with PKCE (S256)
- Client authentication via client_secret_basic OR client_secret_post
- Refresh tokens
- RFC 8414 Authorization Server Metadata
- RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata
- WWW-Authenticate: Bearer with resource_metadata pointer (so MCP clients
  discover the auth server from a 401 on the webhook URL)

Single-tenant by design: one client_id / client_secret pair, configured in
the addon. The consent screen displays the requesting redirect_uri so the
user can verify they're authorizing the connector they meant to.

Tokens are signed (HMAC-SHA256) with a per-install secret persisted at
/config/.mcp_proxy_oauth_secret. They contain enough state to validate
without a server-side store, so the integration survives restarts.
